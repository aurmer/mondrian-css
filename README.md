# Flexbox Mondrian Painting

Piet Mondrian was a 20th century Dutch painter whose paintings emphasized simple geometric elements.

This is a recreation of the Mondrian Painting through the use of CSS Flexbox layout logic.

I initially attempted solving it with wrapping flex elements, but quickly realized that relying on absolute sizing would be overly difficult. I opted to use no wrapping and instead every tile and section uses flex-grow.

My final thoughts are that this is much better solved with a grid layout.
